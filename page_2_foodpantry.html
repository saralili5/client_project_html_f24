        <h3>How to Help</h3><br>
        <p>Thank you for supporting our mission to ensure that no one goes without at U-M. There are many ways you can help:</p><br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Money</strong>: Did you know that when you donate money, your dollar goes ten times further to help a student in need? That’s because we use monetary donations to purchase discounted food from a community food bank. Any amount can make a difference in a student’s life. Please note that all monetary donations must be made online. There are four options for giving. Choose your own donation path to make an impact on-campus for UM community members in need.<br></li>
                <li><strong>Time</strong>: Interested in being a volunteer? Anyone can help, no experience is necessary, and you can sign up for a shift that works with your schedule. If you wish to host a drive, please contact us to see what the Maize & Blue Cupboard currently needs.<br></li>
                <li><strong>Goods</strong>: Consider donating produce, canned and dry goods, cookware and personal care items. To ensure the health and safety of students are met, we only accept items that comply with federal, state, and local food safety regulations.<br></li>
